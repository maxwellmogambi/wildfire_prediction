## Documentation Guide
A README markdown file is required

It should cover:

1. How to set up folders and where each file is saved
2. Order in which to run code
3. Explanations of features used
4. Environment for the code to be run (conda environment.yml file or an environment.txt file)
5. Hardware needed (e.g. Google Colab or the specifications of your local machine)
6. Expected run time for each notebook. This will be useful to the review team for time and resource allocation.

# Wildfire Prediction Challenge

**Can you predict the burned area of wildfires in Zimbabwe?**

## Project Overview

This project is a submission for the Wildfire Prediction Challenge, where the goal is to create a machine-learning model capable of predicting the burned area in different locations across Zimbabwe from 2014 to 2016. The challenge leverages historical data, including climate variables, land cover, population density, and more.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files
- `notebooks/`: Contains the primary Jupyter notebook where the entire data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation were conducted
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries used in the project


## Environment

This project was developed and executed in Google Colab, utilizing its built-in support for Python and easy integration with Google Drive. To run the notebook:
1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab
2. Mount your Google Drive and adjust the file paths accordingly

## Accessing Data

The data files should be placed in your Google Drive in the following path:
`/content/drive/MyDrive/fire-extent-prediction-challenge-120240716-19716-ztmgh3/`

## Running the Code

1. Open in Google Colab: Upload the `wildfire_prediction.ipynb` notebook to Google Colab.
2. Set Up Google Drive: Mount Google Drive using the provided code.
3. Install Required Libraries: Use the requirements.txt file to install the necessary libraries.
4. Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and predictions.

## Project Results

Our team placed third in the competition, achieving a private score of 0.01821023 and a public score of 0.019308177. We explored multiple models and feature engineering techniques to optimize the prediction accuracy.

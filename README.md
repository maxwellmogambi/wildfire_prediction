## Introduction
Each year, thousands of fires blaze across the African continent. These fires can be natural, intentional, or wildfires, each contributing to CO2 emissions and affecting air quality. Understanding the dynamics that influence the occurrence of these fires can help in predicting their future behavior under varying climatic conditions.

## Objectives
The main objective of this challenge is to:
- Develop a machine-learning model capable of predicting the burned area in different locations from 2014 to 2016.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes various features that can be used to predict the burned area. Below is a brief description of the dataset:

| Variable         | Description                                                                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID               | Unique identifier for each area and date (format: [area ID]_yyyy-mm-dd)                         |
| area             | Area ID                                                                                         |
| date             | Date of the data aggregation                                                                    |
| lat              | Latitude of the center of the area                                                              |
| lon              | Longitude of the center of the area                                                             |
| burn_area        | Percentage of the area burned                                                                   |
| climate_*        | Various climate-related features such as evapotranspiration, precipitation, soil moisture, etc. |
| elevation        | Land elevation                                                                                  |
| landcover_*      | Various land cover types                                                                        |
| precipitation    | Merged microwave/IR precipitation estimate                                                      |

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Convert data types if necessary
- Normalize/standardize numerical features
- Encode categorical features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of the target variable (burn_area)
- Identify and visualize correlations between features
- Analyze trends and patterns in the data

### Feature Engineering
- Create new features based on existing data
- Feature selection to identify the most relevant features
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (if necessary)

### Model Development
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Experiment with various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²
- Validate model using the test set
- Perform error analysis to identify areas for improvement

### Prediction and Analysis
- Make predictions on new data
- Analyze and interpret the results
- Visualize the predictions and compare them with actual data
